[:fontawesome-brands-telegram: Telegram](https://t.me/SimpleStockBot){ .md-button } [:fontawesome-brands-discord: Discord](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=532045200823025666&permissions=36507338752&scope=bot){ .md-button }

## Symbol Detection :material-currency-btc: :bank:

The Simple Stock Bot looks at every message it can see and tries to detect stock and cryptocurrency symbols. Stock market tickers are denoted with a single `$` and cryptocurrency coins are denoted with a double `$$`. So getting the price of Tesla is as simple as `$tsla` and Bitcoin `$$btc`. These symbols can be in any part of a message and there can be multiple of them aswell.

    <div class="messages-wrapper">
        <div class="message to">
            I wonder how $tsla is affecting the price of $$btc
        </div>
        <div class="message from">
        The current stock price of Tesla Inc is $866.57, the stock is currently up 1.68%
        </div>
        <div class="message from">
        The current price of Bitcoin is $34,815, the coin is currently down -0.151% for today
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

## Options Detection :bank:

This command allows you to query real-time data for stock options. By simply inputting the stock symbol, strike price, month, and specifying either a call or a put, you can get the latest options data right at your fingertips. For example, `AAPL $220 December call` will provide the current data for Apple's call option with a $220 strike price expiring in December.
