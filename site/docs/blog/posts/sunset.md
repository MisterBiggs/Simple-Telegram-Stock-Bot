I am shutting down Simple Stock Bot, a popular Telegram and Discord bot that provided live stock and cryptocurrency market data. The bot was created in 2018 after my group chat lost access to the Google Allo, which had integrated market data. The bot grew to 15,000 monthly active users, but maintaining the service has become challenging due to increasing data costs and changes to the Discord API. I really appreciate the community and everyone that has donated along the way, this has been a seriously great ride. The bot will soon no longer function on Telegram and Discord.
