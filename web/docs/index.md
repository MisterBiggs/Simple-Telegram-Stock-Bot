# Telegram Bot Commands

## About

If you aren't already, you can talk to this bot here: **[http://t.me/SimpleStockBot](http://t.me/SimpleStockBot)**

Simple Stock Bot is a bot for [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) that provides information about the stock market. You can view the source code [here.](https://gitlab.com/MisterBiggs/simple-telegram-bot). You can also build your own docker container to run [here.](#Build)

## Getting a Stock Quote

Anytime the Bot is in your chat it will search all chats for `$` followed by a ticker. For example `$tsla` will return the following message for Tesla Motors:

```
The current stock price of Tesla Inc. is $321.35, the stock is currently up 2.7%
```

This works no matter where the ticker is in the message and you can have as many tickers as you want in the same message. For example:

```
I wonder how $aapl, $nflx, and $sono are performing today.
```

Will return:

As long as the bot is in your chat it will reply to any stock tickers in your messages.

### /help

This command just displays a short description of what the bot does and a link to this page.

### /news

This command is intelligent enough to get any tickers in the ticker format: `$amzn`, and can handle as many tickers as you would like to enter.
