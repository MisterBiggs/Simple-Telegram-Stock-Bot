# Support Simple Stock Bot

Running Simple Stock Bot incurs a yearly expense of about $420, covering server costs and premium market data subscription from [marketdata.app](https://dashboard.marketdata.app/marketdata/aff/go/misterbiggs?keyword=repo). Every donation helps in maintaining the bot and ensuring its continued availability for all users.

Your support through [Buy Me A Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/Anson) is greatly appreciated, which accepts both PayPal and Credit Card donations.

For Telegram users, a convenient way to donate is by using the `/donate` [command](commands.md#donate-amount-in-usd).

Should you have any inquiries, feel free to get in [touch](contact.md).
